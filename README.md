# devsoc

DEVsoc or social media development is a project that outlines the capabilities of our new social media marketing team. 

We started this project in order to give our team a front page with our companies strategies, goals, and ethics available to a wider scope of clients. We want to be able to reach people from all over the world and assist in a wide range of marketing needs.

This second publication of our webpage consolidates our code to eliminate bugs and gives added accessibility for those requiring the use of screen readers.
